## Sources of Data

The primary sources of data were official reports of countries sent to WHo upon request, official national and subnational websites that contains measurement of PM₁₀, PM₂.₅ and NO₂. Additionally, data were collected directly from official government websites. Where such official data were not available, values from UN Agencies, Development agenicies, regional networks and peer-reviewed journals were used

## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
      
      Measurement: The mean city concentrations was based on daily measurements, or data which were aggregated into annual means. In the absence of annual means, meausrements covering a more limited period of the year were used in exceptional circumstances. However, only data for which the temporal coverage was considered representative of interseasonal variability were included. generally, a cut off of 75% temporal coverage was chosen with exception for low-middle income countries where data availability was very limited.
     
      Estimation: Annual means were reported as provided in the primary source data, or an average of the cities' monitoring stations were used. In order to present air quality that is largely representative for human exposure, urban measurement characterized as urban background, residential areas, commercial and mixed areas were used. Stations characterized as particular 'hot spots' or exclusively indusrial areas were not included, unless they were contained in reported city means and could not be dissociated
